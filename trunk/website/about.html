			<h2><a href="mailto:solubility@gmail.com">Usman Ali</a></h2>
			<h3>Mechanical Designer</h3>
			<p>I went to Mechatronics engineering in UW because i was very interested in robots in high school. during the last coop term, really liked the biomechanics aspect of engineering and therefore decided to work on a final year project related to biomechanics. i believe in applying engineering concepts in biomechanics and learning human systems in the process.
			i like to cook and eat or should it be eat and cook (it looks like a chicken and hen story)</p>

			<h3>Electronics Designer</h3>
			<p>Like most boys, I've always wanted to build a robot friend one day, I just haven't given up on my dreams which has lead me to Mechatronics Engineering. I'm interested in biomechanics because current robots (like Honda's Asimo or whatever) suck really hard... so why are we trying to reinvent the wheel? Cheetas are the fastest animal, Cats in general are very dexterous, and the human body has proved itself the most capable multi-purpose machine in existance, so I figure biomechanics is essential to robotics.</p>
			<p>Big interest in robotics, cognitive science, embedded systems</p>

			<h3>Software Design</h3>
			<p>Being a dedicated designer &amp; a passionate programmer, I have a history of spending 6+ hours daily in front of the computer doing the two. Before computer-age, I used to break toys apart and build my own circuits from the gems i found inside. Though I'm interested in robotics &amp; aerospace, my zeal for using Engineering knowledge to improve someone's health outweighs them. That's why i find myself as part of the team who's building Smart Orthotics.</p>

			<h3>Information/Research Specialist</h3>
			<p>As the information integrator, I gather all relevant information regarding current Orthotics technology and recommend a course of action based on that information. I am in the Biomechanics option while pursuring an interest in the financial field, thus allowing me to maintain a wide field of perspective on the project. I have interests in maintaining marketing viability, solid engineering design, and biomechanics relevance.</p>
